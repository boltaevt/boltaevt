- 👋 Hi, I'm Timur Boltaev

- 👀 I am interested in becoming a really good Software Engineer. At the present moment I am exploring JAVA and the Spring Framework. Plan to become OCP Certified withing the next month. 

- I also try to read more to better understand and cultivate for myself the best practices in programming, e.g. so far have gone through "Understanding software" by Max Kanat-Alexander, "Fundamentals of Software Architecture" by Mark Richards, Neal Ford. I loved "Coders at Work" by Peter Seibel with the reflections on how to become a better programmer from Donald Knuth, Brendan Eich, Joshua Block and others.

- My main reason in switching from the practice of corporate law to programming is: (a) the intellectual challenge; (b) rather than a specific body of law, JAVA is the same in every county where it is written.

- Apart from programming I am interested in fasting weakly for 36+ hours on water, studying math, running and meditation.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of project that I can be of help in.
